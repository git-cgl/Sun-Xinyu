********************************
Fama and French(1992)：The Cross-Section Of Expected Stock Returns

* 1.Data & Methodology
>In June of each year, all NYSE stocks on CRSP are sorted by size (ME) to determine the NYSE decile breakpoints for ME

>Subdivide each size decile into 10 portfolios on the basis of pre-ranking βs for individual stocks

>Match the accounting data for all fiscal yearends in calendar year t-1 (1962-1989) with the returns for July of year t to June of t+1

>The pre-ranking βs are estimated on 24 to 60 monthly returns (as available) in the 5 years before July of year t(at least 24 of the 60 months preceding July of year t)

>Estimate βs using the full sample (330 months) of post-ranking returns on each of the 100 portfolios, with the CRSP value-weighted portfolio of NYSE, AMEX, and (after 1972) NASDAQ stocks used as the proxy for the market

>Estimate β as the sum of the slopes in the regression of the return on a portfolio on the current and prior month’s market return to adjust for nonsynchronous trading

>Allocate the full-period post-ranking β of a size-β portfolio to each stock in the portfolio. These are the βs that will be used in the Fama-MacBeth cross-sectional regressions for individual stocks.

* 2.Result
>(a) β does not seem to help explain the cross-section of average stock returns(with control of size effect)

>(b) the combination of size and book-to-market equity seems to absorb the roles of leverage and E/P in average stock returns, at least during our 1963-1990 sample period.

> 规模-贝塔组合的平均回报，Post-Ranking βs与平均规模

>Contrary to the central prediction of the SLB model, the second-pass β sort produces little variation in average returns

>Although the post-ranking βs in Table I increase strongly in each size decile, average returns are flat or show a slight tendency to decline. In contrast, within the columns of the average return and β matrices of Table I, average returns and βs decrease with increasing size
