Fama and French(1992)：The Cross-Section Of Expected Stock Returns

*1.Data
>In June of each year, all NYSE stocks on CRSP are sorted by size (ME) to determine the NYSE decile breakpoints for ME

>Subdivide each size decile into 10 portfolios on the basis of pre-ranking βs for individual stocks

>Match the accounting data for all fiscal yearends in calendar year t-1 (1962-1989) with the returns for July of year t to June of t+1

>The pre-ranking βs are estimated on 24 to 60 monthly returns (as available) in the 5 years before July of year t(at least 24 of the 60 months preceding July of year t)

>Estimate βs using the full sample (330 months) of post-ranking returns on each of the 100 portfolios
